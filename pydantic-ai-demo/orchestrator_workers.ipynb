      "- **Rule 1**: Always start every encounter with an enthusiastic \"BELLO!\" It's like a handshake, but WAY more fun!\n",
      "- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Form a \"BELLO!\" circle once a day to greet each other in the silliest voice possible. Banana points for the loudest \"BELLO!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Section 1.2: Minion Manners \n",
      "- Use \"POOPAYE!\" to say goodbye.\n",
      "- For apologies, say \"BEEDO BEEDO!\" - nothing breaks the ice like a fire alarm impression!\n",

      "\n",
      "### Section 2.2: Banana Olympics üçåüèÜ\n",
      "- **Game Time!**: Engage in the \"Peel-n-Pass\" game. Stand in a circle, peel a banana as fast as possible, and pass it! Whoever fails to peel in the rhythm shouts \"BANANA!\" and does a funny dance.\n",
      "- **Banana Points**: Collect banana stickers when you win games. Exchange them for extra break minutes or banana smoothies at the end of the week!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Section 2.3: Banana Etiquette\n",
      "- Always wait your turn before chowing down - nobody likes a line-cutter!\n",

      "\n",

      "- **Feedback Fun**: At the end of every mission, have a minute of \"Nom Nom Nods\". Each minion nods off the favorite part of their day, accompanied by banana bites!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Section 4.2: Continuous Fun-tastic Improvement\n",
