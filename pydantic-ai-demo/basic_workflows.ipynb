    "- **Automatic**: Just have Ollama running with models installed\n",
    "- **Manual**: Set `AI_MODEL=ollama:model-name` in your `.env` file\n",
    "- **Custom URL**: Set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` if using a remote Ollama server\n",

    "#### Available Models:\n",
    "The system automatically detects all your locally installed Ollama models. Popular choices include:\n",

    "- `mistral` - Mistral AI's efficient model  \n",
    "- `deepseek-coder` - Specialized coding model\n",
    "- `phi4-mini` - Microsoft's compact model\n",

       "\n",
       "Firstly, operating the shrink ray requires understanding its core functions and adhering to vital safety protocols. Here's a simple guide to get you started:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initial Charge and Calibration**: Ensure the shrink ray is charged to full capacity. Power levels are crucial - an undercharged shrink ray might cause irregular shrinking patterns. To calibrate, set the dial to the specified range indicated in Section 3.1 of the Gadget Operations Manual.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Safety Protocols**:\n",
       "   - **Maintain a safe distance**: Always stand behind the designated line when firing the shrink ray. Refer to Section 3.4 for illustration.\n",
       "   - **Target Alignment**: Ensure the target is aligned within the green reticle of the targeting screen. Alignment prevents misfires and ensures perfect shrinking efficiency.\n",
       "   - **Avoid Eye Contact**: Do not point the shrink ray towards reflective surfaces or the eyes of other minions. Quite important to maintain good minion bonds, eh?\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Firing**: Once safety checks are confirmed, gently pull the trigger while maintaining steady aim. Slow and steady, Minion Bob!\n",
       "\n",
       "For additional guidance, see Section 4 on Shrink Ray Usage Best Practices. This contains helpful diagrams and FAQs for troubleshooting common errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Related skills that can enhance your operational efficiency might include:\n",
       "- **Stealth and Maneuverability**: Essential for sneaking into tight spaces and successfully avoiding detection post-shrinking activities.\n",
       "- **Quick Problem Solving**: A must-have for situations where a quick escape is necessary due to unexpected gadget behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, practice makes perfect! If possible, join the mini training session tomorrow morning at 9 AM in the Lair's laboratory. Ask for Dr. Gadget-weard—you'll gain hands-on experience under expert supervision.\n",
       "\n",
