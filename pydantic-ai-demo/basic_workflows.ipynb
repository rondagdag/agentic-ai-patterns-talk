      "Firstly, let's focus on safety protocols. Remember, a safe minion is a happy minion. In the Shrink Ray Operations Manual, navigate to Section 4.1: \"Safe Ray Handling\" to get acquainted with safety measures like wearing protective goggles (Safety Goggle Protocol 7b) and earmuffs to shield you from residual laser sounds.

      "3. **Aim Carefully**: Hold the shrink ray steady and aim using the scope. Remember, practice makes perfect. Review aiming tips in Section 6.3: \"Precision Targeting.\"\n",
